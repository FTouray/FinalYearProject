# glycolog_flutter

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## SERVER
cd "C:\Users\ftour\OneDrive - Technological University Dublin\4th Year\FYP\glycologapp\glycolog"
python manage.py runserver 
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

ngrok http 8000

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

## FRONTEND
cd "C:\Users\ftour\OneDrive - Technological University Dublin\4th Year\FYP\glycologapp\glycolog_flutter"
flutter run

## RETRAIN MODEL
python model_training.py

## Maybe move to services/auth_service.dart
- auth_service
- login(String username, String password): Handles user login and token storage.
- *logout(): Clears tokens from storage.
- isLoggedIn(): Checks if the user is currently authenticated.
- getUserDetails(): Fetches details of the currently logged-in user.
- updateUserProfile(Map<String, dynamic> profileData): Updates user profile information.

## TOKEN
- Have a look at token refresh - when restart the app still logged in -**

## FORMAT TIMESTAMP

## Login
- Forgot Password
- Password Validation

## Register
- Email and Password Validation

## Homepage
- When you go from homepage to other page and back to homepage users first name doesn't appear and it defaults to user

## Glucose Log
- *Validation for if they have no previous log 
- *Frontend 
- *Measurement unit - can't enter 300 if using mmol/L 
- Filter Not Working - glucose level and remove filter

*Graph*
- *Label Axis 
- *Change the y-axis to display more hours 
- *Graph for GL Today 
- *Round to 1 or 2 Decimal Points 
- Match the y-axis glucose levels to the grid

# GRT

- Error Handling in calculate_totals
- Meal Selection Counter doesn't update immediately when an item is removed from the confirmation screen and they navigate back to meal selection screen
- Celery and Redis - Automate the process of updating the database with new food items from the website

1. GRT Analysis Screen
Purpose: Provides visual insights into logged data, such as trends in glucose levels and food response patterns.
Reason for Priority: Once users have enough logged data, this screen can start generating insights, empowering users with meaningful feedback on their habits.
1. GRT Food Database Screen
Purpose: Allows users to explore available foods, view glycaemic index details, and easily add items to their meal logs.
Reason for Priority: This feature enhances the ease of meal logging by providing a convenient database of foods, giving users a streamlined way to add information to their logs.
1. GRT Alerts and Notifications Screen
Purpose: Allows users to set thresholds for blood glucose levels and customize notification settings.
Reason for Priority: This screen offers helpful reminders and alerts, which are valuable for adherence but can be built after core logging and analysis features are functional.
1. GRT Meal Recommendation Screen
Purpose: Suggests alternative food options based on logged responses to help users make healthier choices.
Reason for Priority: Recommendation features can be added later as they depend on logged data and analysis insights to provide valuable suggestions.
1. GRT Personalization and Settings Screen
Purpose: Enables customization, like setting glycaemic thresholds and dietary preferences.
Reason for Priority: Tailoring the app for each user is valuable but can come after core features, as it enhances the experience rather than forming its basis.
1. GRT Data Export Screen
Purpose: Lets users export their data for personal use or to share with healthcare providers.
Reason for Priority: Data export is useful for users wanting to take their data outside the app but is generally less essential for in-app functionality and can be developed last.

Step 3: Implement Glycaemic Response Analysis in Backend
Once logging is functional, you can start developing the response analysis feature. Initially, you could implement a simplified analysis to provide users with basic insights based on logged meals.

Data Analysis Logic: Write a function to analyze trends in glucose data relative to meals. For instance, check if specific foods consistently lead to higher glucose spikes.
Insights Generation: Generate basic recommendations or warnings based on trends (e.g., "Consider reducing high-GI foods like bread to manage glucose spikes.").
You can implement this analysis as a Django management command or an API endpoint that processes logged data and returns insights.

Step 4: Integrate Glycaemic Response Tracker Insights in the Frontend
Once you have insights generated on the backend, display these insights in the Flutter app.

Insights UI: Design a page or section that shows users how specific foods or meal times affect their glucose levels.
Data Visualization (Optional): Add graphs or visualizations to make data trends clear (e.g., using fl_chart for displaying response trends over time).

# Questionnaire
- Edit Answers in review page
- Enhancing the Experience:
Interactive Features:

Allow the user to hover over data points for detailed values.
Enable filtering by date ranges or specific events (e.g., meal types or exercise types).
Annotations:

Allow users to annotate graphs to mark specific events (e.g., "felt bad today") for easier correlation.
Recommendations:

Based on patterns in the data, provide personalized recommendations (e.g., "Try avoiding high GI foods after 7 PM" or "Exercise for at least 30 minutes to improve wellness").
Statistical Analysis:

Incorporate simple statistical insights (e.g., correlation coefficients) to highlight stronger patterns, such as "Glucose levels have a strong negative correlation with wellness."

- Edit answer make sure it updates
# Info Gathered
Response Completeness:

Identify unanswered questions (-1 values) to gauge user engagement.
Highlight trends in frequently skipped questions.
Behavioral Trends:

Track patterns over time (e.g., increase/decrease in exercise intensity or meal skipping).
Compare different metrics, such as stress vs. wellness, or exercise vs. glucose levels.
Correlations:

Identify relationships between metrics:
Does higher stress correlate with worse wellness scores?
Do skipped meals lead to lower glucose control or reduced exercise intensity?
Personalized Insights:

Provide feedback to users based on their trends:
"You're skipping meals more often; consider revisiting your meal schedule."
"Increased exercise intensity correlates with improved wellness."
Data for Interventions:

Highlight areas for potential intervention:
If many users report "severe" fatigue and stress, suggest stress-reduction techniques.
For skipped questions, prompt users with more engaging forma

virtual health coach could I use open ai for it and basically it can advice the user on different exercise regimen based on data that is in the database for that and in this chat they should be able to see past regimen and exercises and also the data that was captured from the phone or smart watch (the feature may need to be renamed) 

## OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY", "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")

ðŸ”œ Step 2: Store and Show Past Exercise Advice (So users can see past recommendations).
ðŸ”œ Step 3: Connect to Google Fit / Apple Health (Optional).
ðŸ”œ Step 4: Build the Flutter UI for Virtual Health Coach Chat.
